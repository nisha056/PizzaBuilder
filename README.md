# PizzaBuilder

This is an app based on the usage of redux-toolkit.
All the ingredients are kept as component for maintaining their state. The ingredients are either added or removed form the pizza and the state is stored in those components by the usage of redux- toolkit.
It clearly shows the changes in states in user interactive form through the usage of buttons and pizza in UI.
